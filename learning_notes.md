Title : CPU Visual Simulator

URL : https://cpuvisualsimulator.github.io/ 

Summary : This website allows you to visualize how the parts in a CPU communicate with each other and the RAM to complete a set of instructions from code

Key takeaways
- The Program Counter always starts at 0 and is always increased by 2 every time
- At the beginning of the cycle after the Program Counter increases by 2, the first few steps are usually always : 
	- Program Counter sends information through Address Bus
	- Fetch operation is sent from Control Unit through Control Bus
	- Instruction loaded into Instruction Register
	- Opcode is decoded in the Decoder
- The address numbers are all even numbers	
	- Start from 0 and increased by 2, up to 34
	- Each address in the RAM has a different instruction

Personal insights 
- The website is very good at demonstrating the way a CPU works visually, while also giving instructions for every step	
	- Tells you what is happening and where information is being sent across the CPU

Feedback : This website has helped me understand more about the mini processes that are happening quickly in the CPU in devices I use daily

Reflection : Being able to see what happens in the CPU visually with instructions to follow demonstrates how there are many complicated processes, 
information and instructions are being sent in such a short time and small parts in a CPU. It also demonstrates how every part in a computer or devices in general
need to work and communicate together in order to perform efficiently



Title : Visual Transistor-level Simulation of the 6502 CPU and other chips!

URL : http://www.visual6502.org/

Summary : This website contains several simulations of different chips that were developed along the history of computers, the main one being the 6502 chip

Key takeaways
- The creators of the website want to preserve what old technology was like
- Using high resolution photographs, the people who participated in the creation of the website created a vector polygon with the components of the 6502 chip
	- Totalled up to about 20,000 components
- The model can run basic programs, as well as some games from Atari

Personal insights 
- Even the older pieces of technology contain many small components that work together to create another one of many that work together in a device
	- Components are put together to make a CPU, but the CPU is also only a small part of a large PC (in the PC, you have multiple parts - CPU, GPU, motherboard, RAM, etc, 
	then inside the CPU, you have more components)

Feedback : Even though it seems like a device is just pieces of technology put together, 
the users really miss out on the bigger picture, or in this case smaller, with all the components working together

Reflection : Devices like handheld phones are relatively small, but it is hard to believe that the small parts that make the handheld devices, 
have even smaller components within them doing all the complicated processes in short amounts of time
